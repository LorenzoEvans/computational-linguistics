 ## Generative linguistics seeks to lay out a precise and computational model of how human language is constructed.
### How do speakers turn the meaning they want to transmit into verbal communication?
### How do listeners map these signals to the proper meaning that they posses (both the words and the listeners).
### How do learners develop the techniques to resolve these issues?
 ## These are vast questions, and thus cannot be answered simply:
### We will touch perceptual systems of consciousness, the meaning of meaning, and more. In order to do this, we must assume some things.
### We seek to isolate empirical data that we want to analyze, and create models of the world to explain that data.
### Without some assumptions, we can not decide what phenomena to analyze, thus we must take some assumptions with us into the fray.
### First, we must focus on the nature of the structure of sentences.
> John loves Mary.
         
We know the meaning of this sentence is derived in part, from the arrangement of it's parts, or it's *composition*. The sentence *Mary Loves John*, is certainly not equivalent. We could even take *love Mary John, which seems to have no meaning at all. This demonstrates that the principle that outlines the grammaticality of a sentence is not dependent on whether or not that sentence has meaning, or carries information.

So, in short, we can safely begin our analysis with structure, and asking whether or not they *could* be grammatically correct, regardless of whether or not they are *meaningful*.
