# Formal Languages

We have chosen grammaticality, as our starting point, however now, we are forced to precisely outline what we **mean** when we say grammaticality. This definition, will fundamentally draw on Set Theory.

The basic notion in Set Theory, is the set: a discrete collection of distinct elements.

The most fundamental relationship, is membership, which lets us express what elements belong to what set(s).

#### The set of all x such that x is a member of the Naturals and x is greater than or equal to ten.

We use a variable, ranging over the elements of our set, and placing conditions on them, with the bar `|` meaning "*such that*".

There is one set, the empty set, which is a *subset* of every set, and contains no elements as members.

Additionally, a set that contains a single element, is a *singleton* set.
> Singleton sets are not equivalent to the elements they contain.

We write the cardinality of a set as follows: <img align="center" src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%7C%3Cset%20name%3E%7C" alt="|&lt;set name&gt;|" />
