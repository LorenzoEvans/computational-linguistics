The study of #linguistics as we know it, was founded in the 1950's, via the application of computational discoveries to the area of language.
One of the foremost advances, was the [[Chomsky Hierarchy]], which lays out an ordinal relationship of #phase-structure-grammars, which are predicated upon #rewrite-rules, such as: $$\small S -> \text{NP}\;\text{VP}$$
Chomsky demonstrated that limiting the structure of these rules into four categories (#left-linear, #context-free, #context-sensitive, #unrestricted), results in classes of languages that are nested: $$\small \ell_{LL} \sub \ell_{CF}, \ell_{CS}, \ell_{UR}$$
The above hierarchy is pivotal in theoretical [[Computer Science]], and is the basis of study for [[Formal Grammars]] in #linguistics.
