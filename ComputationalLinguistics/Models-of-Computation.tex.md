- # How does language work?
- # How is it represented in the mind?
- # How is it processed?
- # These are the top priorities of the field of study we call #linguistics, also referred to as #generative-linguistics.
    - # [Generative Linguistics]([[Generative Grammar]]).
- # People like [[Kurt GÃ¶del]], [[Alan Turing]], and [[Alonzo Church]] were very influential here.
- # These people were tinkering with basic models of computation, such as [[Turing Machines]], [[General Recursive Functions]], and [[The Lambda Calculus]].
- # Originally, they (the models) were purposed with, aiding in the formalization of #mathematical-computation, the process of writing theorems.
- # It was soon realized that [[The Lambda Calculus]] and [[Turing Machines]], were equivalent in some sense, and thusly it was stated that #Turing-complete formalisms, represented the boundary of that which could be reliably, or effectively computed. (This is known as the [[Church-Turing Thesis]]). 
- # Additionally, it was noted that specific machines in either formalism, were capable of universal computation: they could be programmed to complete the task of any given machine.
- # Elsewhere [[Claude Shannon]] was contemplating the inner workings of the transmission of information, when there was uncertainty in play, giving rise to [[Information Theory]].
