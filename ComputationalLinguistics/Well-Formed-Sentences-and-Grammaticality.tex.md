 ## Generative linguistics seeks to lay out a precise and computational model of how human language is constructed.
     ### How do speakers turn the meaning they want to transmit into verbal communication?
     ### How do listeners map these signals to the proper meaning that they posses (both the words and the listeners).
     ### How do learners develop the techniques to resolve these issues?
 ## These are vast questions, and thus cannot be answered simply:
     ### We will touch perceptual systems of consciousness, the meaning of meaning, and more. In order to do this, we must assume some things.
     ### We seek to isolate empirical data that we want to analyze, and create models of the world to explain that data.
     ### Without some assumptions, we can not decide what phenomena to analyze, thus we must take some assumptions with us into the fray.
 ## First, we must focus on the nature of the structure of sentences.
