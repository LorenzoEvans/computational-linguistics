# Learn Computational Linguistics in Clojure


## A course on computational linguistics, via [Foundations of Computational Linguistics](https://foundations-computational-linguistics.github.io/chapters/01-Introduction.html).

### Goals:
> Learning foundational conceptual tools needed to understand computational models of linguistic structure.
> Understanding the notion of a model of computation and how it can be applied to understand aspects of linguistic structure.
> Understanding the notion of a model of computation and how it can be applied to understand aspects of linguistic structure.
> Learning a bunch of specific, useful skills such as programming in ClojureScript.
